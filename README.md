## Election-Audit Summary:

This Python script was a very helpful tool to process all the votes and get to the results fast and without mistakes. It can be used for any election by modifying:
-	The input data source used for the analysis. Any election votes can be analyzed with this script.
-	The data given in the final report. Maybe it is needed to know how many votes a candidate won per county.
-	The format of the final report can be modified in its order and structure. 

This scrip is very cost effective because the implementation for other election audits will be very cheap, and the results obtained will be fast and precise.  
If there is any other election audit we can help this election commission, we would be glad to do it.
